TO WHOM THIS MAY CONCERN,



RE: BANK, AUDIT, AND SECURITIES FRAUD INVESTIGATION(S) [CASE 01416925]

ANNEXED IN NYSCEF MATTER 153974-2020 ARE THE ORIGINAL CUSTODIANS (HSBC) WHO CARRIED THE UNLAWFUL RENTS AND INTEREST, UPON REASONABLE BELIEF HOLDS THE SAME FOR ALL OF THOSE PROPERTIES WITHOUT LEGAL GROUNDS TO COLLECT RENT.

DOCKET 166, ANNEXED IN NYSCEF MATTER 153974/2020 REPRESENTS THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS (UNLAWFUL SECURITY DEPOSITS) FOR THE PROPERTIES AND WITH RESPECT TO LOAN 50074 CANNOT BE DEFEASED WITHOUT ALL LIENS CLEAR.

THOSE INTERESTS AND RISKS WERE PASSED ON TO STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AS REFERENCED IN THE NYC DEPT. OF FINANCE REGISTER BY AND BETWEEN PARTIES AND FIRST NOTARIZED BY STATE FARM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ON MAY 11, 2020. THE DIRECTORS OF CRD FIRM 43036 REPORT THIS AS A MATERIALLY SUBSTANTIVE CONFLICT, AS IT IS DISCLOSED ON THE CRD OF ITS DIRECTORS AS SUCH. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, THE UNDERLYING RISK AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS ARE DEEMED "REPORTABLE" AS AN BUSINESS, SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY A PART TIME PAPER DELIVERY JOB.

ABSENT OF THE UNLAWFUL DEPOSITS, ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN A HEROIN DEALERSHIP —ARE UNLAWFUL AT ANY US DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, PER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION. THIS MAY CAUSE SOME CONFLICTS WITH AUDIT AND WITH RESPECT TO WHICH PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE INTERBANK LENDING AND TIER 1 RESERVES REPORTED BY HSBC BANK AND ALSO JP MORGAN CHASE BANK.

IF YOU NEED ME TO NOTARIZE ANYTHING, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU REVIEW THE DOCKETS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020 (SEQUENTIALLY AND PRIOR TO ANY FURTHER INTRUSION OF MY TIME OR MY OPINION IN THE MATTER). I ONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE SARBANES-OXLEY, AND NAMELY ALL OF THOSE INTERIM REVISIONS, WHICH OVER THE COURSE OF TIME HAVE BECOME LESS "RELAXED" WITH RESPECT TO "MINIMUM TRIGGERS" AND "MINIMUM FINES", AS THE TRIGGERS MOVED LOWER AND FINES GREW HIGHER.
