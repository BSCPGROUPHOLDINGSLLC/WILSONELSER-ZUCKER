                CONTINUE, which is why there is NO DOLLAR AMOUNT OF BAIL THAT SHOULD WARRANT ANY FURTHERANCE. AS THEY CONTINUE TO "HIT THOSE PIPES"

                    Thank you in advance for addressing this matter.

                    I do hereby consent, as I did and was approved in the FBI as a faction under my supervisors using 

                    cellphone from T-Mobile 917-378-3467. 

                    These individuals ONLY do this to further impede the timely release of information to you, and yours and while they delete their emails, my emails, and other information that WILL deter further losses of assets, notwithstanding a waste of my own time.

                     More information that will be further encumbered without bringing an end to this Zucker Organization, its attorneys, employees, affiliates, notwithstanding their accessories at Columbia University. 

                    Have your analysts review those recordings and let me know otherwise, is not funny, and they believe they are exempt from prosecution — which is insanity.



                    I am registered, and approved in the FBI system… 

                    As such I also authorize you to monitor this phone at all times, as it is not helpful to have a “select group” of self-declared “overachievers” gain a competitive advantage by looking over my shoulder, listen to my conversations and a willful violation of my privacy which continues and during a FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF SECURITIES FRAUD, BANK FRAUD, TAX FRAUD, and other areas of the Law I am not familiar with.

                    Here is all the information you need for this device, 

                    646-256-3609, without consent has been monitored

                    — absent of those who work in the interest of an expedited release of information, as requested earlier, I don’t want to hear or see a peep, I have to clear this before they pull another smooth merger and lose another two billion dollars.

                    So #CLEAR ANYONE who has undertaken a self-declared initiative to track this device, without my consent at any anytime, as implied

                    —without exception, does nothing but slow this process and make life difficult for you, yours and myself included.

                    Here is the information for this device, which they use to monitor my “activities” are in FACT not fictitious, no matter what excuse.
